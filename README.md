# BioPype

_This tool is currently a work-in-progress and does not represent the final 
product. Files and features are in varying stages of completion and will likely
change throughout the development process._

This tutorial aims to improve a newcomer's general understanding of bioinformatics by...
  1) Defining technical terms commonly used in bioinformatics, 
  2) Providing a collection of useful resources for learning about bioinformatics, and 
  3) Demonstrating how Python can be used to answer specific research questions by combining existing bioinformatics tools.
