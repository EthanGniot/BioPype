    \section{Explanation of @staticmethod decorator vs @classmethod decorator in Python}
    \label{app:static-method}
    \textit{The Basics}: Static methods make code easier to read and let you use a class' methods without needing to have an object of that class first. This is useful when it makes logical sense to place a function within a class (because the function is related to the other tasks that the class handles), but the function doesn't \textit{need} to operate on an object/the data of that class. Normal methods are called by typing: \verb|my_object.method|. Static methods are called by typing: \verb|MyClass().method| or \verb|MyClass.method|.

    This link contains:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item An explanation of the FASTQ file format
    \item An explanation of PHRED quality scores with an accompanying figure (Fig 4)
    \item The following quote: "Fastq format is not strictly defined and its variations will always cause headache for you. See \url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK242622/} for more information."
        \begin{itemize}
        \item From the NCBI link: "Text formats, such as FASTQ, are supported, but are not the preferred submission medium. Poorly defined specifications and high variability within these formats tend to lead to a higher frequency of failed or problematic submissions."
        \end{itemize}

% When you define a \label outside a figure, a table, or other floating objects, the label points to the current section. In some cases, this behavior is not what you'd like and you'd prefer the generated link to point to the line where the \label is defined. This can be achieved with the command \phantomsection as in this example:

%The link location will be placed on the line below.
%\phantomsection
%\label{the_label}
%%%%%%%%%%
